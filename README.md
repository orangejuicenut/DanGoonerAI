# DanGoonerAI
Copies tags from Danbooru for use in NovelAI

I did use Claude to make this, don't go around thinking I am any good at programming lmao. 

## Instructions:

This piece of crap software is very bad, run at own risk. I don't even know how to compile it into a real extension. 

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder

The extension will add a floating button on Danbooru pages and provide a popup interface for easy tag extraction and copying.
The formatted tags will be ready to paste directly into NovelAI's prompt field!
